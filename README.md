# Stroll -  A dog walking app
Stroll is a full stack web app to track your dog walks and store notes associated with every walk.

## Getting Started
To use the app go to https://on-a-stroll.herokuapp.com.

New users can create an account utilizing passport.js.

Each user is able to create a list of multiple dogs including a profile picture.

During the walk the user can track locations of dog on dog interactions, dog friendly businesses or locations of free dog poop bags.
There is also a stop watch function to track the duration of every walk.
